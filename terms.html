          DroneLogbook may notify authorities or take any actions it deems appropriate, without notice to you, including
          immediate termination of your account, if DroneLogbook suspects or determines, in its own discretion, that you

          Service or any policies or rules established by DroneLogbook; or (ii) engaged in actions relating to or in the
          course of using the Site or Services that may be illegal or cause liability, harm, embarrassment, harassment, abuse

          Upon any termination by a DroneLogbook User, the related account will no longer be accessible. Any suspension,
          termination or cancellation will not affect your obligations to DroneLogbook under these Terms of Service (including,
          without limitation, the rights granted by you to DroneLogbook, indemnification and limitation of liability), which
          by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination or cancellation. After any termination,
          you understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation to provide the Site or Services and all
          licenses and other rights granted to you by these Terms of Service will immediately cease. DroneLogbook will not
